## Summary

8 years building AI systems — from model integration and evaluation to production infrastructure. At Parcha, built the AI platform from scratch: LLM orchestration, evaluation pipelines, continuous model monitoring, plus the infra underneath (K8s, Terraform, Prometheus/Grafana). Platform serves enterprise fintech clients with sub-second inference across 50+ data sources.

## Skills

- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes, Docker, Terraform, GCP, AWS, Prometheus, Grafana, GitHub Actions
- **Backend**: Python (async), REST APIs, gRPC, PostgreSQL, BigQuery, Redis, Celery, FAISS, pgvector
- **AI/ML Systems**: LLM orchestration, model deployment, inference pipelines, RAG, embeddings
- **Practices**: SOC 2 compliance, observability, rate limiting, multi-tenant architecture

## Experience

### Parcha — Founding AI Engineer
**Sep 2023 – Present** | San Francisco, CA

First engineering hire. Built AI inference platform from zero to production serving enterprise clients.

**Platform & Infrastructure**
- Replaced external DevOps; own full infrastructure stack: Terraform, GCP, Kubernetes, secret management, CI/CD
- Built rate-aware control plane for million-record migrations — balances K8s pod scaling against LLM API limits (RPM/TPM) with automatic backpressure
- Implemented Prometheus/Grafana observability stack; created dashboards for latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization
- Designed multi-tenant architecture serving concurrent enterprise clients with isolated workloads
- Implemented technical controls for SOC 2 Type II certification — security controls, access management, audit logging

**API & Service Design**
- Architected core APIs for 50+ data source integrations (OpenCorporates, SEC, courts, sanctions lists across 200+ jurisdictions)
- Built deployment automation with configurable depth modes: FAST (single-agent, sub-second), DEEP (expanded tooling), ULTRA-DEEP (parallel sub-agent orchestration)
- Implemented queuing and caching layers for high-throughput batch processing

**AI Platform**
- Core architect of **Grep.ai** — ranked **#1 on DeepResearch Bench** (54.37), achieving **99.7% accuracy**
- Designed multi-agent orchestration system with 300+ skills across 16 industries
- Built "Capture First, Measure Later" telemetry pipeline for production model monitoring

### Carvana — Team Lead, Machine Learning
**Mar 2022 – Aug 2023** | Remote

Led 4-person ML team. Early LLM adopter pre-GPT-4.

- Led cross-functional initiative to deploy LLMs into production — document understanding, knowledge base Q&A, customer-facing chatbot with custom fine-tuned models
- Built gRPC services for chatbot inference; message processing pipeline in Scala
- Fine-tuned LayoutLM and DocumentAI models for document understanding; processed vehicle titles, registration, and financing paperwork at scale
- Promoted from Sr. ML Engineer to Team Lead within first year

### Augment CXM — Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**Aug 2017 – Jun 2022** | San Francisco, CA

Core ML team building conversational AI platform.

- Deployed FAISS vector database for semantic search over millions of conversational records
- Developed patented LSTM model for next utterance prediction — core product IP
- Shipped production NLP models: topic analysis, clustering, sentiment, NER
- Established Airflow as primary MLOps platform for model training and deployment pipelines

*Previously: Core Algorithms and Data Science (Aug 2017 – Aug 2019)*
