## Summary

8 years building AI systems — from model integration and evaluation to production infrastructure. At Parcha, built the AI platform from scratch: autonomous multi-agent systems (Grep.ai), evaluation pipelines, continuous model monitoring, plus the infra underneath (K8s, Terraform, Prometheus/Grafana). Platform serves enterprise fintech clients with high requirements for response time, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

## Experience

### Parcha — Founding AI Engineer
**Sep 2023 – Present** | San Francisco, CA

First engineering hire. Technical #2 behind CTO. Built the AI platform from scratch.

**Product & Architecture**
- Core architect of **Grep.ai** — ranked **#1 on DeepResearch Bench** (54.37), achieving **99.7% accuracy** on PhD-level research tasks
- Early adopter of **Anthropic Agent SDK**; built MCP integrations for 50+ data sources (OpenCorporates, sanctions lists, adverse media, SEC, patents, courts across 200+ jurisdictions)
- Designed multi-agent system with 300+ skills across 16 industries; depth modes from 10s to 15min replacing days of manual research

**Evals & Model Governance**
- Created regulatory-grade documentation for enterprise clients — dataset sourcing, evaluation methodology, assumptions, limitations — used for compliance and regulatory approval
- Built "Capture First, Measure Later" observability pipeline; integrated Braintrust and Scorecard for trace-based evals and LLM-as-judge monitoring on production samples
- Identified false negatives during enterprise pilot; validated fix on 100 prod cases (Low Risk: 17%→11%, High Risk: 12%→18%), then productized into self-service "Evaluate Criteria Changes" UI for compliance teams

**Client-Facing**
- Joined CEO on sales calls to explain model governance and AI reliability to enterprise prospects
- Supported client compliance teams through rollouts, post-go-live tuning, and ongoing case reviews

**Infrastructure**
- Replaced external DevOps consultant; owned Terraform, GCP, Kubernetes, Prometheus/Grafana, BigQuery, GitHub Actions, secret management
- Orchestrated million-record migrations with rate-aware control plane, manually balancing K8s scaling against LLM token limits (RPM/TPM)
- Implemented technical controls for SOC 2 Type II certification — security controls, access management, audit logging

**Team & Culture**
- Early Claude Code adopter (April 2025); developed feature.md planning workflow, converted team from Cursor through organic standup demos

### Carvana — Team Lead, Machine Learning
**Mar 2022 – Aug 2023** | Remote

Led 4-person ML team. Early LLM adopter pre-GPT-4.

- Led cross-functional initiative to deploy LLMs into production — document understanding, knowledge base Q&A, customer-facing chatbot with custom fine-tuned models
- Built gRPC services for chatbot inference; message processing pipeline in Scala
- Fine-tuned LayoutLM and DocumentAI models for document understanding; processed vehicle titles, registration, and financing paperwork at scale
- Promoted from Sr. ML Engineer to Team Lead within first year

---

### Augment CXM — Senior Machine Learning Engineer
**Aug 2017 – Jun 2022** | San Francisco, CA

Core ML team building conversational AI products.

- Developed patented LSTM model for next utterance prediction — core product IP
- Deployed FAISS vector database for semantic search over conversational data
- Shipped production NLP models: topic analysis, clustering, sentiment, NER
- Established Airflow as primary MLOps platform

*Previously: Core Algorithms and Data Science (Aug 2017 – Aug 2019)*
