I build AI systems that have to work—not just in demos, but in production where mistakes cost money and trust.

## What I Do

Currently **Founding AI Engineer at [Parcha](https://parcha.com)**, where I'm building AI agents for compliance automation. Most recently shipped [Grep.ai](https://grep.ai)—an AI-powered due diligence platform built on Anthropic's Agent SDK that researches businesses across 190+ jurisdictions in under 3 minutes.

The hard part isn't getting LLMs to work. It's making them reliable enough to bet your business on.

**My focus areas:**
- **Production Agent Systems** — Handling real-world complexity beyond the "happy path"
- **Evaluation Frameworks** — Designing rigorous tests for high-stakes AI (compliance, finance)
- **Reliability** — Reducing false positives by 90%+ without sacrificing recall

## Background

15+ years in data systems across fintech, automotive, and enterprise.

**Previously:**
- **ML Team Lead at Carvana** — Led machine learning team, shipped models serving millions of users
- **Senior MLE at Augment CXM** — 5 years building core algorithms and data science platform

I specialize in the messy intersection of research-quality AI and production-grade engineering.
